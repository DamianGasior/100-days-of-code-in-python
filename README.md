# Python Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my learning process in Python, based on practical questions, exercises, and mini-projects I have explored.  
The goal of this journey is to master Python foundations and build skills in **data analysis, machine learning, and AI product management**.

## 📌 Covered Topics

### 🔹 Python Basics
- Variables, data types, loops, and conditions  
- Functions, arguments, and return values  
- String manipulation & searching within text  

### 🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- `class` and object creation  
- `__init__` method and instance attributes  
- Class-level vs. instance-level variables  
- `__str__` representation of objects  
- Working with lists of objects (e.g., Book library example)  

### 🔹 Iterators & Generators
- Using `yield` for lazy evaluation  
- Understanding why generators return values one by one  
- Looping through generators  

### 🔹 Error Handling & Logging
- Using `try/except` blocks  
- Logging with different levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`)  

### 🔹 Git & Collaboration
- Checking differences between local and remote branches  
- Using `.gitignore` (auto-generated by GitHub) and understanding its sections 
- Working on local branches 


### 🔹 Data Analysis Foundations
- Introduction to `pandas` and data manipulation  
- Basics of regression and classification models  
- Example project: predicting USD/PLN exchange rate using external features
